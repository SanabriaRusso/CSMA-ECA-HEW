CSMA/ECA Implementation
------------------------

These source files are part of the UPF's current project that aims at simulating Ken Duffy's proposal of deterministic backoff timers and the concept of stickiness.

At the moment, CSMA/ECA is implemented with both Hysteresis and Fair Share mechanisms. Please refer to [1] to learn more about the protocol behavior and results.

Future plans include the incorporation of 802.11e QoS mechanisms and other PHY enhancements like MU-MIMO.
