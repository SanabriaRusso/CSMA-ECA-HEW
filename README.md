============
CSMA-ECA-HEW

Modelling of Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Enhanced Collision Avoidance for the upcoming High-Efficiency WLANs standard.

This attempt will modify:

	-Symbol times to comply with 802.11ax
	-Sources model iLBC for voice and H.264/AVC for video ([1] and [2], respectively).

WARNING:
The code is the result of evolutionary learning, both the subject matter and C++ itself.

Now I see clearly. Some of the proposed enhacements are:
	- Treat each included function as a method of the parent component
	class.
	- Move all kind of knobs and settings to the main file.
	- Create helpers and well defined scenarios to avoid mistakes.

Please, feel free to send pull requests. I may actually take a look at them.
